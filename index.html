			<p class="subtitle">What is this?</p>
			<p>
				This is just a game concept that unites two awesome games into one: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong" target="_blank">Pong</a>, one of the first arcade games ever created, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)" target="_blank">Portal</a>, one of the most innovative games ever created.
			</p>
			<p class="subtitle">How do I play it?</p>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>Get a friend, since this is a game for two (or you can play against yourself, which is fun too)</li>
					<li>The goal is to score a point by having the ball cross over your opponent's racket</li>
					<li>Hit <b>space</b> to start. Player 1 uses <b>Q</b> to move the racket upward and <b>A</b> for downward. Player 2, respectively, uses <b>P</b> and <b>L</b></li>
					<li>When the ball is moving right and goes through the blue portal, it comes out of the orange portal and vice-versa.</li>
					<li>Have fun.</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p class="subtitle">Is that it?</p>
			<p>
				Yes. As I said, this is only a concept. If you have any interesting ideas to make it better, you can either share them with me
				or create your own version. The code is available at <a href="https://github.com/antoniolopes/PortalPong" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
